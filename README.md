# About Me

**_Economist & Data Scientist_**

I've applied data analysis and visualization to drive strategic value for 10+ years across industries like *public security*, *e-commerce*, and *healthcare*.
I use `Python`, `SQL`, and `Tableau` to transform raw data into clear, actionable data products (*webpages, slideshows, dashboards*) that support decision-making, occasionally incorporating regression and classification analyses.
Background in **Economics** (BA), **Information Technology** (MA) and **Data Science & Machine Learning** (Certification).
Committed to fostering data literacy, I share some posts on Learning Data and T3CH via [Medium](https://medium.com/@jesuslm). 

This repository contains a collection of projects showcasing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.
Many of these projects are published on Posit, allowing for interactive exploration of the analyses.
