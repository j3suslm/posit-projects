# About Me

**_Economist & Data Scientist_**

I've applied data analysis and visualization to drive strategic value for 10+ years across industries like *public security*, *e-commerce*, and *healthcare*.

I use `Python`, `SQL`, and `Tableau` to transform raw data into clear, actionable data products (*webpages, slideshows, dashboards*) that support decision-making, occasionally incorporating regression and classification analyses.

Background in **Economics** (BA), **Information Technology** (MA) and **Data Science & Machine Learning** (Certification).
Committed to fostering data literacy, I share some posts on Learning Data and T3CH via [Medium](https://medium.com/@jesuslm). 

This repository contains a collection of projects on data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.
Many of these projects are published on Posit, allowing for interactive exploration of the analyses.


## Projects

**Project 1: [Stunning Visualizations with Datawrapper](https://jesuslm-my-website.share.connect.posit.cloud/portfolio/posts/python/datawrapper_api.html)**
    
  * Description
      
    Data visualization is a powerful tool for conveying insights and making data accessible to a wider audience. Meanwhile Python offers a plethora of libraries for creating visualizations, Datawrapper provides a unique approach by combining the flexibility of custom code with the ease of a user-friendly interface.
    This article explores the benefits of integrating Datawrapper into Python workflows for efficient and effective data visualization.
    Datawrapper is a powerful online tool designed to help you create engaging and informative data visualizations.
    Whether you’re a journalist, researcher, or simply someone who wants to present data in a more visually appealing way, Datawrapper can make the process quick and easy.
    
  * Tools Used
    
    `Python`, `Datawrapper`, `pandas`, `tabulate`
