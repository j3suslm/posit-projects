# Creating Visualizations with Python & Datawrapper[^1]

[^1]: The main objective of this paper is to show how you can use Datawrapper API and create pdf documents within the Python ecosystem without using other tools. Visit its official [website](https://www.datawrapper.de)

#### Import libraries

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
from datawrapper import Datawrapper
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import json
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv('.env')
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

#### Connect to Datawrapper

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false

# read credentials
token = os.getenv('datawrapper_api')
# Acces datawrapper
dw = Datawrapper(access_token = token)
```

[This paper is based on my Medium article [Datawrapper: A Powerful Tool for Creating Stunning Data Visualizations](https://medium.com/learning-data/datawrapper-a-powerful-tool-for-creating-stunning-data-visualizations-1dc194e57b7b)]{.aside}

#### Read dataset

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
df = pd.read_csv('data/data.csv', sep=";",)
```

```{python}
#| tbl-label: tbl-people
#| tbl-cap: Where people live in by type of area
#| tbl-cap-location: margin

from IPython.display import Markdown, display
from tabulate import tabulate
display(Markdown(df.to_markdown(index = False)))
```

#### Create Datawrapper chart

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
pop = dw.create_chart(
    title='Where do people live?', chart_type='d3-bars-stacked', data=df
)
```

#### Update chart description

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
dw.update_description(
    pop['id'],
    source_name = 'UN Population Division',
    source_url = 'https://population.un.org/wup/',
    byline = 'Jesus L. Monroy<br>Economist & Data Scientist<br><br>',
    intro = 'Population percentage living in the capital by Country'
)
```

#### Publish chart

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
dw.publish_chart(chart_id = pop['id'])
```

#### Customize metadata

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
dw.update_chart(
    chart_id = pop['id'],
    metadata = {
        'visualize': {
            'sharing': {'enabled': True},
            'thick': True,
            'custom-colors': {
                '%pop in rural areas': '#dadada',
                '%pop in urban areas': '#1d81a2',
                '%pop in the capital': '#15607a',
               },
           },
        'publish': {
            'blocks': {'get-the-data': False},
           },
    }
)
```

#### Republish chart

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
dw.publish_chart(pop['id'])
```

#### Display chart

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
dw.display_chart('SbWmd')
```
