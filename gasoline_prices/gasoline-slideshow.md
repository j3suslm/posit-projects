# Conclusions

In most states, filling a 40-liter car tank costs around $1,000 pesos.

While precise price predictions are difficult, it’s reasonable to expect continued volatility in gasoline prices in Mexico during 2025.

The interplay of global oil markets, government policies, and domestic economic conditions will create a dynamic environment. Consumers should be prepared for potential price fluctuations and consider strategies for managing their fuel expenses.

The energy sector, meanwhile, will be closely watched as Mexico navigates the complex challenges of ensuring affordable and accessible fuel for its population.

The future of gasoline prices in Mexico remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: it will continue to be a topic of significant importance for both consumers and policymakers.
