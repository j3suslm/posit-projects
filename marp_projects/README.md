## About

**Economist & Data Scientist**

For over a decade, I’ve leveraged data analysis and visualization to deliver strategic value across diverse sectors like public security, e-commerce, and healthcare. I use `Python`, `SQL` and `Tableau` to collect, transform, and analyze raw data, creating actionable data products (*webpages, slideshows, dashboards*), ocasionally including regression and classification analyses to support informed decision-making.

Background in *Economics* (BA), *Information Technology* (MA) and *Data Science and Machine Learning* (Certification).

Committed to fostering data literacy, I share some data posts on Learning Data and T3CH via [Medium](https://medium.com/@jesuslm).
