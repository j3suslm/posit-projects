# Dashboards

A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more specific objectives. 

It is tipically displayed and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.

Dashboards are commonly designed to provide a real-time view of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. 

They are often interactive, allowing users to drill down into specific data points to gain deeper insights.
