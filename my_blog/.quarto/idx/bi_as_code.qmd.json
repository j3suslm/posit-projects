Monroy</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Economist &amp; Data Scientist</emp>\n</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1Lmri73DDQJok6s_L2gnLng.gif\" alt=\"code or not to code\" style=\"float:center; margin-right: 1em; width: 100%;\">\n\n<h1>No-Code Stage: Combining SQL and Tableau</h1>\n\n<p>A Winning Combination and the next step to BI as Code</p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">In the world of data analysis and visualization, <b>Tableau</b> has established itself as a powerful tool for transforming numbers into impactful visual insights.\nHowever, the way we feed those dashboards has a significant impact on their performance, flexibility, and scalability.\nHere's why using <b>SQL</b> to prepare your data before bringing it into Tableau is a superior strategy.</p>\n        \n<h2>Why SQL as a Paintbrush for Your Tableau Dashboards?</h2>\n        \n<img src=\"https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/es-es/Img/customsql_ds_logical.png\" alt=\"tableau and sql\" style=\"float:center; margin-right: 1em; width: 100%;\">\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Imagine <b>Tableau</b> is your canvas and the data is the paint. <b>SQL</b> acts as your expert color mixer, allowing you to prepare exactly the shades and proportions you need before applying them to the canvas. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>\n        \n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimized Performance</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">Instead of loading large amounts of raw data into Tableau and relying on its data engine to perform complex transformations, SQL lets you filter, aggregate, and transform data directly in the database. This means Tableau works with much smaller, optimized data sets, resulting in faster and more responsive dashboards.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Greater Flexibility and Control</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">SQL gives you granular control over your data transformation logic. You can perform complex joins, apply conditional logic, create calculated fields, and shape the data exactly as you need it for your specific visualizations. This is much more flexible than relying solely on Tableau's capabilities for these tasks.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Reuse and Consistency</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">SQL queries can be saved, versioned, and reused across multiple dashboards or even different tools. This promotes consistency in business logic and reduces work redundancy.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Scalability</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">As your data volumes grow, performing heavy transformations within Tableau can become prohibitively expensive in terms of performance. Delegating these tasks to the database via SQL allows your solution to scale more efficiently.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Data Warehouse Integration</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">If your organization already uses a data warehouse, SQL is the native language for interacting with it. Using SQL to prepare data for Tableau integrates naturally with your existing data infrastructure.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n        \n<h2>The Ideal Workflow: SQL First, Tableau Later</h2>\n\n<p>An efficient workflow involves:</p>\n        \n<ul>\n<li><strong>Connecting Tableau to the database</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">Using custom SQL queries or materialized views to prepare and shape the data. This includes filtering, aggregations, joins, and any other necessary transformations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Building visualizations</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">Using Tableau drag and drop from the pre-processed data.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n        \n<hr>\n\n<h1>Shifting to BI as Code: Evidence.dev</h1>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">While the combination of SQL and Tableau is powerful, modern tools like <b>Evidence.dev</b> are emerging as interesting alternatives that seek to further simplify the process of creating data-driven dashboards.</p>\n        \n<img src=\"https://evidence.dev/changelog/usql.gif\" alt=\"sql and markdown\" style=\"float:center; margin-right: 1em; width: 100%;\">\n\n<p><strong>SQL as the Primary Language</strong></p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">Similar to the strategy we promote, Evidence.dev uses SQL as its primary language to define data logic and visualizations. This means there's less of a clear separation between data preparation and visualization.</p>\n        \n<p><strong>Code-Defined Visualizations</strong></p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">Visualizations in Evidence.dev are defined using code (primarily Markdown with SQL code blocks), which offers even greater control and facilitates collaboration and versioning through systems like Git.</p>\n        \n<p><strong>Integrated Pipeline</strong></p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">Evidence.dev essentially integrates the data pipeline and visualization into a single tool. You don't need a separate tool like Tableau for visualization after preparing the data with SQL.</p>\n        \n<p><strong>Focus on Data Engineering</strong></p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">Evidence.dev is more aligned with data engineering principles, promoting transparency, reproducibility, and maintainability in the dashboard creation process.</p>\n        \n<h2>Replacement or Integration?</h2>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">While Evidence.dev offers an attractive alternative, it doesn't necessarily have to be a complete replacement for the SQL + Tableau combination in all cases.</p>\n        \n<p><strong>Potential Replacement</strong></p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">For teams with a strong focus on data engineering and who value full control through code, Evidence.dev could be an excellent option to replace the traditional SQL + Tableau workflow.</p>\n        \n<p><strong>Strategic Integration</strong></p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">It is also possible to integrate Evidence.dev into an existing Tableau workflow. For example, data models defined and transformed in Evidence.dev could be used as data sources for Tableau dashboards, leveraging the strengths of both tools.</p>\n        \n<hr>\n        \n<h1>Unleashing the Power of Python as BI as Code: Plotly Dash</h1>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">Tired of static reports and clunky spreadsheets?

This powerful library brings the magic of reactive web applications directly to your Python workflow, making dashboard creation more intuitive and accessible than ever before.</p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">For those familiar with the R ecosystem, Shiny needs little introduction. Now, Pythonistas can leverage its elegant framework to build dynamic dashboards without needing extensive web development knowledge. Imagine: interactive charts that respond to user inputs, filterable tables that reveal hidden insights, and customizable layouts that perfectly showcase your findings –all built with the Python you already know and love.</p>\n        \n<img src=\"https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/assets/tipping-dashboard.png\" alt=\"code\" style=\"float:center; margin-right: 1em; width: 100%;\">\n\n<h2>Why Choose Shiny for Python? Let's Dive into the Advantages:</h2>\n        \n<p><strong>Python Powerhouse</strong></p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">You can seamlessly integrate your favorite Python data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly directly into your dashboards. This means you can perform complex data manipulation and visualization within the same familiar environment.</p>\n        \n<p><strong>Reactive Magic</strong></p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">Shiny's core strength lies in its reactivity. When a user interacts with an input (like a slider or dropdown), the linked outputs (charts, tables, text) automatically update in real-time. This creates a fluid and engaging exploratory experience for your audience.</p>\n        \n<p><strong>Simplified Web Development</strong></p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">Say goodbye to wrestling with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript intricacies. Shiny for Python abstracts away much of this complexity, allowing you to focus on the logic and presentation of your data. Its declarative syntax makes defining UI elements and their behavior remarkably straightforward.</p>\n        \n<p><strong>Customizable Layouts</strong></p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">Tailor your dashboards to your exact needs with flexible layout options. Arrange elements in columns, rows, or use more advanced grid systems to create visually appealing and informative interfaces.</p>\n        \n<p><strong>Shareability</strong></p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">Once your dashboard is built, deploying it is relatively simple. You can share it with colleagues, stakeholders, or even the wider world, enabling data-driven decision-making and communication.</p>\n        \n<p><strong>Growing Ecosystem</strong></p>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">While still relatively new compared to its R counterpart, the Shiny for Python ecosystem is rapidly expanding. Expect to see more components, extensions, and community support emerge over time.</p>\n        \n<h2>What's Improved? Building on the Shiny Legacy:</h2>\n        \n<p align=\"justify\">Shiny for Python benefits from the years of experience and refinement of its R predecessor.
