Monroy**   \n*Economist & Data Scientist*\n\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/images/penguins-shiny.png\" alt=\"bi as code\" style=\"float:center; margin-right: 1em; width: 90%;\">\n</div>\n\n# No-Code Stage: Combining SQL and Tableau\n\nA Winning Combination and the next step to BI as Code.\nIn the world of data analysis and visualization, *Tableau* has established itself as a powerful tool for transforming numbers into impactful visual insights.\nHowever, the way we feed those dashboards has a significant impact on their performance, flexibility, and scalability.\nHere's why using *SQL* to prepare your data before bringing it into Tableau is a superior strategy.\n        \n## Why SQL as a Paintbrush for Your Tableau Dashboards?\n\n![](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/es-es/Img/customsql_ds_logical.png)\n\nImagine *Tableau* is your canvas and the data is the paint. *SQL* acts as your expert color mixer, allowing you to prepare exactly the shades and proportions you need before applying them to the canvas. Here are some of the key benefits:\n        \n- **Optimized Performance**\n\n  Instead of loading large amounts of raw data into Tableau and relying on its data engine to perform complex transformations, SQL lets you filter, aggregate, and transform data directly in the database. This means Tableau works with much smaller, optimized data sets, resulting in faster and more responsive dashboards.\n\n- **Greater Flexibility and Control**\n\n  SQL gives you granular control over your data transformation logic. You can perform complex joins, apply conditional logic, create calculated fields, and shape the data exactly as you need it for your specific visualizations. This is much more flexible than relying solely on Tableau's capabilities for these tasks.\n\n- **Reuse and Consistency**\n \n  SQL queries can be saved, versioned, and reused across multiple dashboards or even different tools. This promotes consistency in business logic and reduces work redundancy.\n\n- **Scalability**\n\n  As your data volumes grow, performing heavy transformations within Tableau can become prohibitively expensive in terms of performance. Delegating these tasks to the database via SQL allows your solution to scale more efficiently.\n\n- **Data Warehouse Integration**\n\n  If your organization already uses a data warehouse, SQL is the native language for interacting with it. Using SQL to prepare data for Tableau integrates naturally with your existing data infrastructure.\n        \n## The Ideal Workflow: SQL First, Tableau Later\n\nAn efficient workflow involves:\n        \n- **Connecting Tableau to the database**\n\n  Using custom SQL queries or materialized views to prepare and shape the data. This includes filtering, aggregations, joins, and any other necessary transformations.\n\n- **Building visualizations**\n\n  Using Tableau drag and drop from the pre-processed data.</p>\n        \n---\n\n# Shifting to BI as Code: Evidence.dev\n        \nWhile the combination of SQL and Tableau is powerful, modern tools like *Evidence.dev* are emerging as interesting alternatives that seek to further simplify the process of creating data-driven dashboards.\n        \n![](https://evidence.dev/changelog/usql.gif)\n\n**SQL as the Primary Language**\n        \nSimilar to the strategy we promote, Evidence.dev uses SQL as its primary language to define data logic and visualizations. This means there's less of a clear separation between data preparation and visualization.\n        \n**Code-Defined Visualizations**\n        \nVisualizations in Evidence.dev are defined using code (primarily Markdown with SQL code blocks), which offers even greater control and facilitates collaboration and versioning through systems like Git.\n        \n**Integrated Pipeline**\n        \nEvidence.dev essentially integrates the data pipeline and visualization into a single tool. You don't need a separate tool like Tableau for visualization after preparing the data with SQL.\n        \n**Focus on Data Engineering**\n        \nEvidence.dev is more aligned with data engineering principles, promoting transparency, reproducibility, and maintainability in the dashboard creation process.\n        \n## Replacement or Integration?\n        \nWhile Evidence.dev offers an attractive alternative, it doesn't necessarily have to be a complete replacement for the SQL + Tableau combination in all cases.\n        \n**Potential Replacement**\n        \nFor teams with a strong focus on data engineering and who value full control through code, Evidence.dev could be an excellent option to replace the traditional SQL + Tableau workflow.\n        \n**Strategic Integration**\n        \nIt is also possible to integrate Evidence.dev into an existing Tableau workflow. For example, data models defined and transformed in Evidence.dev could be used as data sources for Tableau dashboards, leveraging the strengths of both tools.\n\n---\n        \n# Unleashing the Power of Python as BI as Code: Plotly Dash\n        \nTired of static reports and clunky spreadsheets?
