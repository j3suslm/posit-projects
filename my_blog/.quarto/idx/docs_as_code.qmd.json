What if we treated documentation with the same care and rigor as our codebase?</p>\n\n<p>That's the core idea behind <em>Documentation as Code</em>.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">It's a paradigm shift that advocates for managing and creating documentation using the same tools, workflows, and principles we apply to writing and maintaining software.\nInstead of siloed documents living in shared drives or outdated wikis, your documentation lives alongside your code in your version control system (e.g., Github).You use familiar tools to write it (<em>Markdown, AsciiDoc, or reStructuredText</em>), build it automatically, test it, and deploy it just like any other part of your project.</p>\n\n<h2>Why should you embrace Documentation as Code?</h2>\n\n<p>There are diverse benefits, including the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Version Control &amp; Collaboration</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">Just like your code, your documentation benefits from the power of version control. Track changes, collaborate effectively through pull requests, and easily revert to previous versions. No more wondering who made what change or struggling to merge conflicting edits.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Automation &amp; Consistency</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">Automate the build process to generate consistent and well-formatted documentation. This eliminates manual steps prone to errors and ensures your documentation always reflects the latest code.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Living Documentation</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">By integrating documentation with your development workflow, you ensure it stays up-to-date. Changes in the code can trigger updates in the documentation, preventing the dreaded scenario of outdated or misleading information.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Discoverability</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">When documentation lives alongside the code, it's easier for developers (and anyone else) to find the information they need, right where they expect it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Quality</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">The review process inherent in version control and pull requests applies to documentation as well. This leads to more accurate, clearer, and more comprehensive documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Developer Involvement</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">By using familiar tools and workflows, developers are more likely to contribute to and maintain the documentation. It becomes less of a separate chore and more of an integrated part of their development process.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Friction</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">Say goodbye to clunky, separate documentation platforms. Everything is in one place, making it easier to create, update, and consume documentation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Key Principles of Documentation as Code</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Plain Text Formats</strong></p>\n<p>Use lightweight markup languages like Markdown or AsciiDoc for easy writing, version control, and tooling.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Version Control</strong></p>\n<p>Store documentation alongside code in a version control system (e.g., Git).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Automation</strong></p>\n<p>Automate the build, testing, and deployment of documentation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Code Reviews</strong></p>\n<p>Subject documentation changes to the same review process as code changes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Treat Documentation as a First-Class Citizen</strong></p>\n<p>Give documentation the same level of importance and attention as your codebase.</p>\n\n<h2>Getting Started with Documentation as Code</h2>\n\n<p>The transition doesn't have to be drastic.
