    "text": "The Mexican National Guard\nProgress, Concerns, and the Future of Public Security\nApr, 2024\nJesus L. Monroy\nEconomist & Data Scientist\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe National Guard (Guardia Nacional - GN) is Mexico’s national gendarmerie, officially established on June 30, 2019. Created with the aim of tackling the country’s high levels of crime and restoring public safety, it absorbed personnel and units from the former Federal Police, as well as the military police and naval police.\n\n\nHistory and Formation\nThe National Guard was initially campaigned on taking the military off the streets. However, facing a persistent security crisis, it was proposed as a new force under military command to prevent and combat crime.\nIn February 2019, the Mexican Congress approved constitutional reforms to create the National Guard. The law regulating the force came into effect in May 2019.\nThe National Guard effectively replaced the Federal Police, which had been plagued by issues of corruption and human rights violations throughout its 20-year existence. While some experts suggested reforming the Federal Police, the decision was made to create a new institution.\nInitially, the National Guard was intended to be a civilian institution under the Secretariat of Security and Civilian Protection. However, in practice, it has been largely composed of military personnel, and in September 2024, its command was officially transferred to the Secretariat of National Defense.\nThe force launched operations with tens of thousands of members and aimed to reach an estimated 120,000 members.\n\n\nFunctions and Responsibilities\nThe National Guard has a broad mandate that includes:\n\nPreventing and combating crime throughout the national territory.\nPreserving public security.\nIntensifying the enforcement of immigration policy, including deployment to the southern and northern borders to control the flow of migrants. This was notably increased as part of agreements with the United States.\nFederal law enforcement duties.\nGendarmerie functions, implying a force with military discipline focused on general law enforcement.\nCivilian police duties, with the power to detain suspects and collaborate with public prosecutors in investigations. They can investigate both federal and common crimes under certain agreements.\nSupporting public security tasks in coordination with state and municipal authorities.\nCivil protection in disasters and crises.\nKidnapping resolution, criminal surveillance, and intelligence gathering.\nBorder protection.\n\nMore recently, the armed forces, including the National Guard, have been assigned additional tasks such as protecting oil pipelines, helping build infrastructure projects, and distributing vaccines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can hover the mouse over the map to get additional information.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns and Criticisms\nThe National Guard has faced significant scrutiny and criticism:\nMilitarization of public security\nA primary concern is the increasing role of the military in traditionally civilian law enforcement tasks. Critics argue this blurs the lines between military and police functions and could lead to issues related to training, accountability, and human rights.\nHuman rights\nThere have been concerns about the training of National Guard members in human rights and allegations of excessive use of force, arbitrary detentions, and other abuses, particularly in the context of immigration enforcement.\nEffectiveness in reducing crime\nDespite its large deployment, some analyses suggest that the National Guard has not yet demonstrably reduced crime or violence in the country.\nAccountability Questions remain about the mechanisms for holding National Guard members accountable for misconduct, with some advocating for strong, independent civilian oversight.\nMission creep\nThe broadening scope of the National Guard’s responsibilities, extending beyond traditional law enforcement to areas like infrastructure and migration control, has raised concerns about its intended purpose and potential overreach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can hover the mouse over the map to get additional information.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nAs of today, the National Guard continues to be a significant security force in Mexico, with a strong military component. It is actively involved in law enforcement across the country, border security operations, and various other tasks assigned by the government. The debate surrounding its role, effectiveness, and adherence to human rights standards remains ongoing. Recent deployments, such as the reinforcement of the northern border with Army troops, highlight the continued reliance on federal forces for security challenges.\n\n\nReferences\n\nStorr, S.

    "text": "Level Up Your Presentations: Embrace Slides as Code\nCreate your slideshows with Marp, Python, and Quarto! 🚀\nApr, 2025\nJesus L. Monroy\nEconomist & Data Scientist\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nTired of wrestling with drag-and-drop interfaces and endless formatting tweaks for your presentations? Ready to embrace the power of version control and reproducible results for your slides. Then it’s time to dive into the exciting world of Slides as Code! This approach treats your presentation content and styling as code, offering a more efficient, collaborative, and maintainable workflow, by using Markdown, Python, and Quarto.\n\n\nWhat’s the Magic Behind Slides as Code?\nInstead of directly manipulating visual elements, you define your slides using a lightweight markup language (like Markdown) and potentially sprinkle in code for dynamic content or visualizations.\nThis offers several key advantages:\n\nVersion Control\nTrack changes, collaborate seamlessly with Git, and easily revert to previous versions. Say goodbye to accidental deletions and confusing “final_final_v3” files!\nReproducibility\nEnsure your presentations are consistent and can be easily recreated. No more wondering how you achieved that specific layout or chart.\nEfficiency\nFocus on your content rather than tedious formatting. Write in a clean, text-based format and let the tools handle the presentation rendering.\nAutomation\nGenerate slides programmatically using Python, pulling data from various sources or creating dynamic visualizations.\nPlatform Agnostic\nOften, the output formats are widely compatible (HTML, PDF, etc.), making sharing and viewing easy.\n\n\n\nMeet the Dream Team\nMarkdown\nA lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Think of it as a simplified way to add basic formatting (like bolding, italics, headings, lists, etc.) to your text using simple symbols. Instead of using complex word processors with menus and buttons, you use characters you already know on your keyboard.\nPython\nThe workhorse for data manipulation, analysis, and generating dynamic content. You can use Python scripts to fetch data, create charts with libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn, and then seamlessly integrate these outputs into your Marp slides.\nQuarto\nThis powerful open-source scientific and technical publishing system ties everything together. Quarto can render Marp Markdown into beautiful presentations, and it also provides excellent support for embedding Python code chunks directly within your Markdown.\n\n\nHow They Work Together?\n\nContent Creation (Markdown)\nYou write your presentation content in a .md file using Marp’s Markdown syntax. You define slide breaks using ---, apply themes, and add basic formatting.\nDynamic Content (Python)\nIf you need to include data visualizations or dynamic information, you write Python code snippets within your Quarto document (which can include your Marp Markdown). These code chunks can:\n\nRead data from files or APIs.\nPerform calculations and analysis.\nGenerate plots and charts using Python libraries.\n\nRendering (Quarto)\nQuarto takes your .md file (with embedded Python if any) and renders it into a polished presentation in your desired format (e.g., HTML reveal.js slides, PDF beamer slides). Quarto handles the execution of your Python code and seamlessly integrates the output into your web presentation.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nSlides as code is the future! The Benefits are Clear. Embracing Slides as Code with Markdown, Python, and Quarto can significantly improve your presentation workflow. You’ll gain better control, enhance collaboration, and create more dynamic and reproducible presentations.

    "text": "Crowding in Social Security Services in Mexico\nThe Case of FOVISSSTE\nApril, 2025\nJesus L. Monroy\nEconomist & Data Scientist\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe strain on Mexico’s public healthcare systems, particularly the Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSSTE) and the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), is a persistent and deeply concerning issue. Overcrowded waiting rooms, lengthy delays, and limited resources paint a stark picture of the challenges faced by both patients and healthcare providers.\n\nISSTE serves approximately 13.7 million Mexican government workers, retirees, their spouses, and underage children.\nTogether with the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), ISSSTE provides health coverage for 55% to 60% of the total Mexican population.\nISSTE primarily focuses on providing healthcare and social services to federal, state, and municipal government employees.\n\n\n\nThe Overwhelming Crowd: A Daily Reality\nReports and personal accounts consistently describe scenes of overwhelming congestion in ISSSTE and IMSS facilities. Patients often endure hours, sometimes even days, of waiting for consultations, treatments, or surgeries. This situation leads to:\n\nExtended wait times\nDelays in receiving necessary care can exacerbate existing health conditions and lead to complications.\nReduced quality of care\nOverburdened staff may struggle to provide adequate attention to each patient.\nPatient frustration and anxiety\nThe stress of long waits and uncertain outcomes can significantly impact patients’ well-being.\nIncreased risk of infections\nCrowded waiting areas can become breeding grounds for contagious diseases.\n\n\n\nRoot Causes of Overcrowding\nSeveral factors contribute to the overcrowding crisis:\n\nInsufficient infrastructure\nThe number of healthcare facilities and medical personnel has not kept pace with the growing population and its healthcare needs.\nUnderfunding\nLimited financial resources restrict the ability of ISSSTE and IMSS to expand capacity, invest in new equipment, and hire additional staff.\nIncreased prevalence of chronic diseases\nThe rising rates of diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic conditions place a significant burden on the healthcare system.\nInefficient administrative processes\nBureaucratic hurdles and delays in scheduling appointments and processing paperwork contribute to longer wait times.\nAging population\nAs the population ages, the demand for healthcare services, particularly for geriatric care, increases.\nLack of preventative care\nA focus on treating illnesses rather than preventing them leads to more people requiring intensive medical intervention.\n\n\n\nConsequences of Overcrowding\nThe consequences of overcrowding extend beyond individual patients, impacting the entire healthcare system and society:\n\nIncreased mortality and morbidity\nDelays in treatment can lead to preventable deaths and worsened health outcomes.\nEconomic burden\nLost productivity due to illness and disability places a strain on the economy.\nErosion of public trust\nFrustration with the healthcare system can erode public confidence in government institutions.\nStrain on healthcare professionals\nOverwork and burnout among doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers can lead to staff shortages and reduced morale.\nIncreased emergency room usage\nWhen regular appointments take too long, people go to emergency rooms, further over crowding those areas.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nAddressing the overcrowding crisis requires a multifaceted approach involving increased investment in infrastructure, improved administrative efficiency, a greater focus on preventative care, and strategies to manage the growing burden of chronic diseases. It is a critical challenge that demands urgent attention to ensure the well-being of the Mexican population.\n\n\nReferences\n\nVazquez, C (2024) Understanding IMSS: Mexico’s Social Security System.

They can analyze how economic policies impact crime rates, helping policymakers understand the potential consequences of their decisions.\nCost-benefit analysis of crime prevention programs\nEconomists can evaluate the economic efficiency of various public security initiatives.\nResource Allocation\nThey can help optimize the allocation of public security resources, ensuring that funds are directed towards the most effective programs and areas. Analyzing the economic impact of crime on communities and businesses.\nUnderstanding illicit economies\nAnalyzing the economic structures of illegal markets, such as those involving drugs, human trafficking, or illegal arms sales. Evaluating the effectiveness of policies aimed at disrupting these markets.\n\n\n\nData Scientist Contributions\n\n\n\nPredictive Policing\nData scientists can develop models to predict crime hotspots and identify individuals at high risk of involvement in criminal activity.\nAnalyzing crime patterns and trends to inform resource deployment.\nData-Driven Crime Analysis\nThey can analyze large datasets from various sources (police reports, social media, etc.) to identify patterns and insights that would be difficult to detect manually. Using geospatial analysis to map crime hotspots and understand spatial patterns.\nImproving Law Enforcement Efficiency\nDeveloping tools to automate tasks, improve data management, and enhance communication between law enforcement agencies. Analyzing the effectiveness of law enforcement strategies and identifying areas for improvement.\nFraud Detection\nData Scientists can build models that detect fraudulent activities, which are often connected to organized crime.\nAnalyzing the effects of social programs\nThey can analyze the effects of social programs on crime rates, and help determine which programs are the most effective.\n\n\n\nSynergistic Collaboration\nWhen economists and data scientists collaborate, they can provide a more comprehensive understanding of public security challenges. Economists can provide the context and theoretical framework, while data scientists can provide the tools and techniques for analyzing the data. This interdisciplinary approach can lead to more effective and evidence-based public security policies. In essence, by combining economic theory with data-driven analysis, these professionals can play a vital role in creating safer and more secure communities.\n\n\n\nKey functions that an economist and data scientist might perform in public security.\n\nCrime Pattern Analysis and Prediction\n\nEconomist Focus\nAnalyze how economic conditions (e.g., unemployment, poverty, income inequality) correlate with crime rates in specific areas. Develop economic models to explain these relationships.\nData Scientist Focus\nUse machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in crime data (time, location, type of crime, offender demographics). Build predictive models to forecast future crime hotspots and times.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\ndef predict_crime_hotspots(crime_data, features, target, test_size=0.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts crime hotspots using a Random Forest Regressor model.\n\n    Args:\n        crime_data (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing crime data.\n        features (list): List of feature columns to use for prediction.\n        target (str): The target variable (e.g., 'crime_rate').\n        test_size (float): Proportion of the data to use for testing.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (model, X_test, y_test) - Trained model, test features, \n        and test target.\n    \"\"\"\n    X = crime_data[features]\n    y = crime_data[target]\n\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, \n    test_size=test_size, random_state=42)\n\n    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n    return model, X_test, y_test\nExample usage:\n''' \nAssuming 'crime_data' is a DataFrame with columns like:\n    'location_x', 'location_y', 'time', 'crime_type', \n    'unemployment_rate', 'poverty_rate', 'crime_rate'\n'''\n\nfeatures = ['location_x', 'location_y', 'time', 'crime_type', \n            'unemployment_rate', 'poverty_rate']\ntarget = 'crime_rate'\nmodel, X_test, y_test = predict_crime_hotspots(crime_data, features,\n                                                target)\npredictions = model.predict(X_test)\nprint(predictions)\n\n\nConclusions\nIn summary, the combined expertise of economists and data scientists offers a powerful toolkit for enhancing public security. Economists illuminate the underlying causes of crime, while data scientists provide the means to predict, prevent, and effectively respond to threats. Embracing this interdisciplinary approach is crucial for developing smarter, more targeted, and ultimately more successful strategies for creating safer communities.\n\n\nReferences\n\nNBER (2025).

    "text": "Documentation as Code: Revolutionizing Your Documentation Workflow\nThe Future of Documentation is Code\nMar, 2025\nJesus L. Monroy\nEconomist & Data Scientist\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Onose, Ejiro\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nLet’s be honest. Documentation often feels like the neglected stepchild of software development. It’s the thing we promise to get to “later,” the first thing to get cut when deadlines loom, and often ends up being outdated and unreliable. But what if we flipped the script? What if we treated documentation with the same care and rigor as our codebase?\nThat’s the core idea behind Documentation as Code.\nIt’s a paradigm shift that advocates for managing and creating documentation using the same tools, workflows, and principles we apply to writing and maintaining software. Instead of siloed documents living in shared drives or outdated wikis, your documentation lives alongside your code in your version control system (e.g., Github).You use familiar tools to write it (Markdown, AsciiDoc, or reStructuredText), build it automatically, test it, and deploy it just like any other part of your project.\n\n\nWhy should you embrace Docs as Code?\nThere are diverse benefits, including the following:\n\nVersion Control & Collaboration\nJust like your code, your documentation benefits from the power of version control. Track changes, collaborate effectively through pull requests, and easily revert to previous versions. No more wondering who made what change or struggling to merge conflicting edits.\nAutomation & Consistency\nAutomate the build process to generate consistent and well-formatted documentation. This eliminates manual steps prone to errors and ensures your documentation always reflects the latest code.\nLiving Documentation\nBy integrating documentation with your development workflow, you ensure it stays up-to-date. Changes in the code can trigger updates in the documentation, preventing the dreaded scenario of outdated or misleading information.\nImproved Discoverability\nWhen documentation lives alongside the code, it’s easier for developers (and anyone else) to find the information they need, right where they expect it.\nEnhanced Quality\nThe review process inherent in version control and pull requests applies to documentation as well. This leads to more accurate, clearer, and more comprehensive documentation.\nDeveloper Involvement\nBy using familiar tools and workflows, developers are more likely to contribute to and maintain the documentation. It becomes less of a separate chore and more of an integrated part of their development process.\nReduced Friction\nSay goodbye to clunky, separate documentation platforms. Everything is in one place, making it easier to create, update, and consume documentation.\n\n\n\nKey Principles of Docs as Code\nPlain Text Formats\nUse lightweight markup languages like Markdown or AsciiDoc for easy writing, version control, and tooling.\nVersion Control\nStore documentation alongside code in a version control system (e.g., Git).\nAutomation\nAutomate the build, testing, and deployment of documentation.\nCode Reviews\nSubject documentation changes to the same review process as code changes.\nTreat Documentation as a First-Class Citizen\nGive documentation the same level of importance and attention as your codebase.\n\n\nGetting Started with Docs as Code\nThe transition doesn’t have to be drastic. Here are a few steps you can take:\n\nChoose a Lightweight Markup Language\nExplore Markdown, AsciiDoc, or reStructuredText and pick one that suits your team’s needs.\nMove Your Documentation to Version Control\nStart by migrating your existing documentation into your project’s repository.\nImplement a Static Site Generator\nTools like Sphinx, MkDocs, Docusaurus, and Jekyll can automatically generate beautiful and searchable documentation from your plain text files.\nEncourage Collaboration\nFoster a culture where everyone feels responsible for contributing to and maintaining the documentation.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nDocumentation as Code isn’t just about the tools; it’s about a mindset shift. It’s about recognizing the crucial role documentation plays in the success of a project and treating it with the respect and rigor it deserves. By embracing this approach, you can create documentation that is accurate, up-to-date, discoverable, and a true asset to your team and users.\n\n\nReferences\n\nOnose E.

    "text": "Why SQL as a Paintbrush for Your Tableau Dashboards?\n\nImagine Tableau is your canvas and the data is the paint. SQL acts as your expert color mixer, allowing you to prepare exactly the shades and proportions you need before applying them to the canvas. Here are some of the key benefits:\n\nOptimized Performance\nInstead of loading large amounts of raw data into Tableau and relying on its data engine to perform complex transformations, SQL lets you filter, aggregate, and transform data directly in the database. This means Tableau works with much smaller, optimized data sets, resulting in faster and more responsive dashboards.\nGreater Flexibility and Control\nSQL gives you granular control over your data transformation logic. You can perform complex joins, apply conditional logic, create calculated fields, and shape the data exactly as you need it for your specific visualizations. This is much more flexible than relying solely on Tableau’s capabilities for these tasks.\nReuse and Consistency\nSQL queries can be saved, versioned, and reused across multiple dashboards or even different tools. This promotes consistency in business logic and reduces work redundancy.\nScalability\nAs your data volumes grow, performing heavy transformations within Tableau can become prohibitively expensive in terms of performance. Delegating these tasks to the database via SQL allows your solution to scale more efficiently.\nData Warehouse Integration\nIf your organization already uses a data warehouse, SQL is the native language for interacting with it. Using SQL to prepare data for Tableau integrates naturally with your existing data infrastructure.",

This means you can leverage your familiar Python workflows to build sophisticated dashboards.\nInteractive and Dynamic\nDash dashboards are inherently interactive. Users can filter data, zoom into charts, hover over data points for details, and trigger updates in real-time. This level of engagement fosters deeper data exploration and understanding.\nDeclarative Syntax\nDash utilizes a declarative syntax, making it incredibly intuitive to define the layout and interactivity of your dashboard. You describe what you want to see, and Dash handles the underlying complexities of building the web application.\nRich Component Library\nPlotly provides a comprehensive library of interactive and customizable components, including charts, graphs, tables, dropdown menus, sliders, and more. These components are built on top of the robust Plotly.js library, ensuring high-quality visualizations.\nCustomizable Layouts\nDash offers flexible layout options, allowing you to arrange components precisely as needed. You can create multi-page dashboards, organize elements into rows and columns, and design visually appealing interfaces.\nDeployment Flexibility\nDash applications can be deployed on various platforms, from local machines to enterprise-level servers and cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, and Google Cloud. This makes it easy to share your dashboards with a wider audience.\nActive Community and Extensive Documentation\nDash boasts a vibrant and supportive community, along with comprehensive and well-maintained documentation. This makes it easier to learn, troubleshoot, and find solutions to your dashboarding challenges.",

    "text": "Why Choose Shiny for Python? Let’s Dive into the Advantages\nPython Powerhouse\nYou can seamlessly integrate your favorite Python data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly directly into your dashboards. This means you can perform complex data manipulation and visualization within the same familiar environment.\nReactive Magic\nShiny’s core strength lies in its reactivity. When a user interacts with an input (like a slider or dropdown), the linked outputs (charts, tables, text) automatically update in real-time. This creates a fluid and engaging exploratory experience for your audience.\nSimplified Web Development\nSay goodbye to wrestling with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript intricacies. Shiny for Python abstracts away much of this complexity, allowing you to focus on the logic and presentation of your data. Its declarative syntax makes defining UI elements and their behavior remarkably straightforward.\nCustomizable Layouts\nTailor your dashboards to your exact needs with flexible layout options. Arrange elements in columns, rows, or use more advanced grid systems to create visually appealing and informative interfaces.\nShareability\nOnce your dashboard is built, deploying it is relatively simple. You can share it with colleagues, stakeholders, or even the wider world, enabling data-driven decision-making and communication.\nGrowing Ecosystem\nWhile still relatively new compared to its R counterpart, the Shiny for Python ecosystem is rapidly expanding. Expect to see more components, extensions, and community support emerge over time.",
