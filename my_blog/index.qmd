For over a decade, I've leveraged data analysis and visualization to deliver strategic value across diverse sectors like public security, e-commerce, and healthcare. I use `Python`[^1] and `SQL` to collect, transform, and analyze raw data, creating actionable data products such as *webpages, slideshows, and dashboards*, ocasionally including *regression* and *classification* analyses to support informed decision-making.

Background in `Economics` (BA), `Information Technology` (MA) and `Data Science` and `Machine Learning` (Certification).

Committed to fostering data literacy, I share some data posts on **Learning Data** and **T3CH** via [Medium](https://medium.com/@jesuslm).

Currently serving as **Deputy Director of Public Policy** at the **Executive Secretariat of the National Public Security System**, responsible for applying analytical skills to assess public security policy initiatives.
