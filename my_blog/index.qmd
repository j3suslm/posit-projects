<!-- Use 03 spaces to create new line -->
I’ve applied data analysis and visualization to drive strategic value for 10+ years across industries like public security, e-commerce, and healthcare.

I use `Python`[^1], `SQL`, and `Tableau` to transform raw data into clear, actionable data products (*webpages, slideshows, interactive reports*) that support decision-making, occasionally incorporating regression and classification analyses.

Committed to fostering data literacy, I share data posts on `Learning Data` and `T3CH` via [Medium](https://medium.com/@jesuslm)

Background in `Economics` (BA), `Information Technology` (MA) and `Data Science` and `Machine Learning` (Certification).

Vegan.
