I’ve applied data analysis and visualization to drive strategic value for 10+ years across industries like public security, e-commerce, and healthcare.
Currently working at the **Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Pública** as *Deputy Director of Public Policy*.


Use `Python`[^1] and `SQL` to collect, transform and analyze statistical and geospatial data in order to generate actionable data products (*webpages, slideshows, dashboards*), occasionally incorporating regression and classification analyses, that support decision-making about evaluation of public security policy initiatives.

Committed to fostering data literacy, I share data posts on `Learning Data` and `T3CH` via [Medium](https://medium.com/@jesuslm)

Background in `Economics` (BA), `Information Technology` (MA) and `Data Science` and `Machine Learning` (Certification).

Vegan.
