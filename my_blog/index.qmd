I'm a professional with +10 years of experience applying data analysis in sectors like public security, e-commerce, and healthcare. Passionate about creating tools that make data accessible and impactful.

Background in `Economics` (BA), `Information Technology` (MA) and `Data Science` and `Machine Learning` (Certification).

Committed to fostering data literacy, I share some data posts on **Learning Data** and **T3CH** via [Medium](https://medium.com/@jesuslm).


### Philosophy: Data as Code

In my work at the intersection of economics and data science, I advocate for a "Data as Code" approach.
While traditional BI tools (like Tableau or Power BI) are useful for quick visualizations, they often create "information silos" that are difficult to version-control, audit, or automate.

My workflow is built on three core pillars:

- **Reproducibility**: Whether it's a security report or an economic forecast, the path from raw data to final insight must be scripted and version-controlled via Git. If a result isn't reproducible, it isn't reliable for policy-making.

- **Modern Data Stack**: I leverage high-performance tools like DuckDB and Polars to process large datasets locally and efficiently. This reduces infrastructure costs and allows for "BI-as-Code" using frameworks like Evidence.app.

- **Narrative-Driven Analytics**: Data is only as good as the story it tells. I use Quarto to blend deep statistical analysis with clear, executive-level prose, ensuring that technical findings lead to actionable policy decisions.


Some of the Python libraries I use include:
