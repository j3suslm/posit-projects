## Economist & Data Scientist

I've applied data analysis and visualization to drive strategic value for 10+ years across industries like public security, e-commerce, and healthcare. 
I use `Python`, `SQL`, and `Tableau` to transform raw data into clear, actionable data products 
*(webpages, slideshows, dashboards)* that support decision-making, occasionally incorporating regression and classification analyses.

Background in **Economics** (BA), **Information Technology** (MA) and **Data Science & Machine Learning** (Certification).
Committed to fostering data literacy, I share some posts on `Learning Data` and `T3CH` via [Medium](https://medium.com/@jesus_lmonroy).
