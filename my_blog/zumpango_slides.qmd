Zumpango Lake

:::

## Overview {.center .smaller}

- The Zumpango lake is technically a regulatory vessel, with a capacity of 100 million cubic meters of water and an approximate surface area of 1,853 hectares.

- The main reason for the construction of this regulatory vessel was at the time to be able to provide water to the agricultural centers of the Zumpango-Nextlalpan-Teoloyucan region.

## Important Events {.center .smaller}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* In 2023, the Zumpango Lake stopped having water and is now almost entirely covered by crassipes water lily.
* This site was a tourist attraction that provided employment to dozens of families in the region, who served restaurants, shops and boat services to tourists who came every weekend, but today everything is abandoned.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

* The more than 2 thousand hectares in which the lake extended are now easily traversable on foot, since the water level dropped so much in 2023 that it ended up drying up.
* Between January and February 2024, large fires consumed dry grasslands and lilies, leaving poor air quality in the surrounding areas.
