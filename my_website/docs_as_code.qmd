# Introduction

Let's be honest. Documentation often feels like the neglected stepchild of software development. It's the thing we promise to get to "later," the first thing to get cut when deadlines loom, and often ends up being outdated and unreliable.
But what if we flipped the script? What if we treated documentation with the same care and rigor as our codebase?

That's the core idea behind *Documentation as Code*.

It's a paradigm shift that advocates for managing and creating documentation using the same tools, workflows, and principles we apply to writing and maintaining software.
Instead of siloed documents living in shared drives or outdated wikis, your documentation lives alongside your code in your version control system (e.g., Github).You use familiar tools to write it (*Markdown, AsciiDoc, or reStructuredText*), build it automatically, test it, and deploy it just like any other part of your project.

# Why should you embrace Docs as Code?

There are diverse benefits, including the following:

- **Version Control & Collaboration**

  Just like your code, your documentation benefits from the power of version control. Track changes, collaborate effectively through pull requests, and easily revert to previous versions. No more wondering who made what change or struggling to merge conflicting edits.

- **Automation & Consistency**

  Automate the build process to generate consistent and well-formatted documentation. This eliminates manual steps prone to errors and ensures your documentation always reflects the latest code.

- **Living Documentation**

  By integrating documentation with your development workflow, you ensure it stays up-to-date. Changes in the code can trigger updates in the documentation, preventing the dreaded scenario of outdated or misleading information.

- **Improved Discoverability**

  When documentation lives alongside the code, it's easier for developers (and anyone else) to find the information they need, right where they expect it.

- **Enhanced Quality**

  The review process inherent in version control and pull requests applies to documentation as well. This leads to more accurate, clearer, and more comprehensive documentation.

- **Developer Involvement**

  By using familiar tools and workflows, developers are more likely to contribute to and maintain the documentation. It becomes less of a separate chore and more of an integrated part of their development process.

- **Reduced Friction**

  Say goodbye to clunky, separate documentation platforms. Everything is in one place, making it easier to create, update, and consume documentation.

# Key Principles of Docs as Code

**Plain Text Formats**

Use lightweight markup languages like Markdown or AsciiDoc for easy writing, version control, and tooling.

**Version Control**

Store documentation alongside code in a version control system (e.g., Git).

**Automation**

Automate the build, testing, and deployment of documentation.

**Code Reviews**

Subject documentation changes to the same review process as code changes.

**Treat Documentation as a First-Class Citizen**

Give documentation the same level of importance and attention as your codebase.

# Getting Started with Docs as Code

The transition doesn't have to be drastic. Here are a few steps you can take:

- **Choose a Lightweight Markup Language**

  Explore Markdown, AsciiDoc, or reStructuredText and pick one that suits your team's needs.

- **Move Your Documentation to Version Control**

  Start by migrating your existing documentation into your project's repository.

- **Implement a Static Site Generator**

  Tools like Sphinx, MkDocs, Docusaurus, and Jekyll can automatically generate beautiful and searchable documentation from your plain text files.

- **Encourage Collaboration**

  Foster a culture where everyone feels responsible for contributing to and maintaining the documentation.

# Conclusions

Documentation as Code isn't just about the tools; it's about a mindset shift.
It's about recognizing the crucial role documentation plays in the success of a project and treating it with the respect and rigor it deserves.
By embracing this approach, you can create documentation that is accurate, up-to-date, discoverable, and a true asset to your team and users.
